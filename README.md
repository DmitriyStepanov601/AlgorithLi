### Definition
The wave tracing algorithm (wave algorithm, Lie algorithm) is a pathâ€”finding algorithm, an algorithm for finding the shortest path on a planar graph. Belongs to algorithms based on breadth-first search methods.

It is mainly used in computer tracing (wiring) of printed circuit boards, connecting conductors on the surface of microcircuits. Another application of the wave algorithm is the search for the shortest distance on the map in computer strategy games.
